# Week 1 - The evolution of safety and risk

## Definition
- Hazard:
	-A potential source of harm.
- Harm:
	-Injury or damage to the health of the people, or damage to property or the environment.
- Risk:
	-The combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.


# Week 2 - Risk Governance
(From Concept to the EU and the Netherlands)

## Risk Governance
![[9c81088b0a29a52dd9e4dbbd224081c4af8a594639398afc64363463a2a35f66.png]]

- Risk governance: extends beyond management
	1. Integrates ==assessment, management and communication==
	2. Required to cope with complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity


## Principles of good risk governance:
- **Openness**: Transparency in sharing information and decision-making processes to stakeholders and the public
- **Participation & Involvement**: Involvement of all relevant stakeholders in risk assessment, management, and communication processes
- **Accountability**: Responsibility of decision-makers to justify actions, decisions, and policies related to risk
- **Effectiveness & Efficiency**: Ensuring that risk management strategies achieve their intended goals without unintended negative consequences
- **Coherence & Consistency**: Consistency of risk-related decisions and actions across different levels and sectors of governance
- **Proportionality & Subsidiarity**: Risk management measures should be commensurate with the severity and likelihood of the risk. Decisions about risk should be taken at the most local level competent to address issues, ensuring that higher levels of governance intervene only when necessary.

### Stakeholders
- Stakeholders: whoever is exposed to risks
- Good risk governance requires the ==involvement of all stakeholders==
- Those who are closest to the risk should have more impact on the decision
- Why involve them - Knowledge, legitimacy and trust


## Risk acceptance criteria
![[e13962116a3cf7c39b3be00a68f01ec186c0769e0abe4b3ce269ea5874841416.png]]
- **==ALARP**==: tolerable risk are significant enough to require being reduced **as  far as reasonably practicable**.

- EU legislation on chemical process safety - ==**REACH==**:
	- **Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals**
- **Seveso Directives**: Managing Major-Accident Hazards
	- EU's main legal framework for major-accident hazards
	- applies to establishments storing dangerous substances above the threshold
- **ADR, RID, ADN, IMDG**: Transport and Handling Road, Rail, Inland Waterways, and Marine
	- control risk during transit, at loading/unloading, and temporary storage
- **Aarhus Convention**: Right to know, participate, and seek justice
	- Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making, and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters



# Week 3 - The Practice of Risk Management
## Decision-making
- The decision analysis cycle
![[b5191fb71eb88408367d36fe62c6d476f8b980e1a4c50586e0b42fa7df9d9591.png]]

- Decision: 
	-A decision is a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources.
- A Good Decision:
	-A good decision is independent of its outcome. You wouldn't change anything about in hindsight.
- A Risky Decision:
	-Dilemma. Multiplicity of equivalent alternatives. Small probabilities. 


## Risk Management
---Preventing or reducing risk consequences through structured steps
### Types of Risks
- **Conventional risks**: Well-defined, quantifiable hazards with known failure modes and data.
	- Managed by conventional approaches: **QRA, ALARP,** ...
	
- **Uncertain/emerging risks**: Risks from new or poorly understood hazards, where probabilities or consequences cannot be reliably estimated.
	*E.g., novel process chemistries, nanomaterials, cyber-attacks on safety systems.*
	- Managed through the **precautionary principle, safe-by-design**
	
- **Ambiguous/contested risks**: Risks where acceptability depends on values, perceptions, or legitimacy rather than technical measures alone. Different stakeholders disagree on what is “safe" enough.
	*E.g., CO₂ storage, ammonia energy carriers, siting of nuclear-related chemical facilities.*
	- Managed through **risk governance structures and stakeholder involvement**
	
- **Systemic/cascading risks**: Risks that spread across interdependent systems, sectors, or time horizons, often triggered by external shocks or unforeseeable internal conditions.
	*E.g., NaTech events (flood causing toxic release), power grid loss leading to runaway reactions.*
	- Managed through **resilience**


### Communication and Consultation
Ongoing two-way exchange of information with stakeholders (operators, authorities, workforce, community) throughout the risk management process.

Contributions:
- Ensures hazards, assumptions, and criteria are transparent.
- Builds legitimacy and trust in risk decisions.
- Brings in diverse knowledge and perspectives to improve identification and evaluation.
- Supports acceptance of chosen treatments and emergency planning.


### Monitoring and Review
Continuous tracking and reassessment of risks, controls, and external conditions to ensure effectiveness over time

Contributions:
- Detects drift, degradation, or new hazards early
- Checks whether implemented measures achieve intended risk reductions
- Provides feedback into identification, analysis, and evaluation steps
- Enables learning and continuous improvement of the overall system


### Establishing the context
Define the scope, objectives, and boundaries of the risk management activity, including external and internal factors, stakeholders, and criteria for evaluating risks. 


### Risk/Hazard Identification
Systematically find, recognize, and describe hazards, threats, or opportunities that could affect objectives, including their causes and potential consequences.

Include: date, trigger, impact, consequence, release, casualties, failures

Methods:
- **HAZOP**: ==Hazard and Operability Study==
	- **What it is:** Structured, team-based review of a process or system.
	- **How it works:** Divide process into “nodes” 
		→ ask systematic “guideword” questions *(e.g., No Flow, More Pressure, Reverse Flow)* 
		→ identify deviations from design intent.
	- **What it gives us:** Helps uncover hidden hazards, operability problems, and possible accident scenarios. Supports safer design and operation.
	
- **FMEA**: ==Failure Modes and Effects Analysis==
	- **What it is:** Systematic, bottom-up method for analyzing how parts can fail.
	- **How it works:** 
		List each component
		→ identify possible failure modes *(e.g., valve stuck open, pump fails)*
		→ assess their effects on the system. Rank by severity, likelihood, and detectability.
	- **What it gives us:** Prioritized list of weak points, guides design improvements, maintenance planning, and resource allocation.
![[26f1881afdedd62a7fba57a01a074fd1876da49c15ba0099c845f8a8642325a4.png]]


###  Risk Analysis
Develop an understanding of the risk by estimating:
- **Frequency/likelihood**: how often the hazardous event could occur.
- **Consequences**: the potential severity of harm to people, environment, assets, or reputation.

Methods:
- **Qualitative risk analysis**:
	- What it is: Uses expert judgment, categories, and descriptive scales *(e.g.“low/medium/high”)*.
	- Examples: **Risk matrices**
	- Use: Early design phases, screening, when data is scarce.
	
- **Semi-quantitative risk analysis**:
	- What it is: Adds numerical scoring or ranking to qualitative approaches.
	- Examples: **LOPA** (==Layers of Protection Analysis==), risk indices.
	- Use: Bridge between qualitative screening and full quantification, prioritization of safeguards.
	
- **Quantitative risk analysis**:
	- What it is: Uses numerical models, frequencies, and consequence calculations to estimate risk in measurable terms (e.g., fatalities per year, individual/societal risk curves).
	- Examples: **Consequence modelling** (dispersion, fire, explosion), **guidelines** such as does in Bevi, and Bevt, and or the Dutch Coloured Books.
	- Use: High-hazard industries (oil & gas, nuclear), land-use planning, regulatory compliance


### Risk Evaluation
Compare analyzed risks against defined acceptance or tolerability criteria to decide whether they are acceptable, need treatment, or require further analysis.

**Risk perception**: 
- The subjective judgment people make about the character, severity, and acceptability of a risk, shaped by cognitive, cultural, and social factors, rather than by technical risk estimates alone.

Risk acceptance:
- ==**ALARP**==: as low as reasonably possible
- **ALARA**: as low as reasonably achievable
	- BAT: best available technology
- **CATNIP**: cheapest available technology not invoking prosecution


### Risk Treatment
Select and implement measures to modify risk by **avoiding, reducing, transferring, or accepting** it, applying the hierarchy of controls.

#### Risk reduction process:
- **Identification**: List all feasible measures that could reduce the risk (technical, organizational, procedural).
- **Assessment**: Estimate the effectiveness of each measure in reducing likelihood and/or consequence, plus costs, feasibility, and side-effects.
- **Evaluation**: Compare the cost and benefit of options against criteria (risk acceptance, ALARP, proportionality, practicality).
- **Selection**: Choose the option(s) that provide sufficient reduction with justified effort and cost.
- **Implementation**: Put the chosen measure(s) into practice in design, operation, or management.
- **Monitoring**: Track performance to ensure the measures actually deliver the intended risk reduction and remain effective over time.


**ISD** - ==Inherently Safe Design==:
- Design approach that aims to **eliminate or minimize hazards at source**, rather than controlling them with add-on safeguards.
- Principles of ISD:
	- Eliminate
	- Substitue
	- Moderate
	- Simplify

==**Hierarchy of controls**==:
- A structured framework for selecting risk reduction measures, which **prioritizes eliminating or substituting** hazards at the source before relying on engineering, administrative, or personal protective measures. It **ranks controls by effectiveness**, with elimination most effective and PPE least effective.
![[04bafc4bd2f3a82fb6f86d6dd9b17f5c614166dd25565e1e17f9c0e9fad2f039.png]]


Inherently Safe Design vs. Hierarchy of Controls:
- Inherently Safer Design is about eliminating or minimizing hazards at the source, usually in **early design stages**. It is preventive by nature and once implemented, doesn’t (heavily) rely on human or equipment reliability.
- Hierarchy of Controls is **broader**. It prioritizes elimination and substitution first (which align directly with ISD principles), then accepts engineered controls, administrative controls, and PPE if elimination/substitution aren’t feasible.


#### Risk treatment of uncertain/emerging risks :
- **==The precautionary principle==**: 
	- Erring on the side of safety when data is scarce
	- Definition: When there is scientific uncertainty about serious or irreversible harm, lack of full evidence shall not be used as a reason to delay preventive action.
	- Key idea: **Better to act early and prevent harm rather than wait for uncertainties to result in disasters**
	- Limitations/debates:
		- Can be seen as over-conservative or a barrier to innovation
		- Needs balance with proportionality and feasibility (cannot ban everything uncertain)
	
- **==Safe by design==**:
	- Definition: It is a preventive approach that integrates safety from the early stages of the product, material, or process development to minimize harm throughout their lifecycle, rather than adding safety measures after a problem has occurred.
	- Characteristic: 
		1. Proactive and preventive
		2. Holistic integration of safety
		3. User-centric
		4. Systemic process
		5. Calls for a cultural shift


#### Risk treatment of ambiguous/contested risks
- Challenges:
	- Technical risk analysis cannot resolve societal disagreement (risk perception)
	- Risk decisions raise issues of fairness, trust, and legitimacy
	
- Treatment approach:
	1. **Stakeholder involvement**: dialogue with communities, workers, NGOs, from the earliest stages of development
	2. **Transparency**: clear communication of uncertainties, assumptions, and trade-offs
	3. **Deliberation & governance**: participatory decision-making
	4. **Adaptive management**: revisiting decisions as science, values, and context evolve.


#### Risk treatment of systemic/cascading risks
- Challenges:
	- Hazards are less predictable, complex systems, digital control, human-system coupling.
	- Tight coupling and interdependencies, one node fails, many nodes fail.
	- External shocks, NaTech events, climate extremes, cyber-physical threats.
	- Long horizons and cross-sector cascades, recovery matters as much as prevention.
	- Societal and regulatory expectations for continuity under all hazards, tolerance for downtime near zero.
	
- Treatment approach:**Resilience**
	- The intrinsic ability of a system to adjust its functioning before, during, or after disturbances, so it can sustain required operations under expected and unexpected conditions.
	- Characteristics:
		- Systemic approach
		- All-hazards orientation
		- Dynamic and adaptive
		- Performance-focused
		- Continuous learning
		- Cross-boundary coordination
	- Core: **No all disruptions can be prevented. Systems must anticipate disruption and plan to withstand** (avoid catastrophic failures) their impact, continue operating while impacted by them, to recover and learn from them. 
	- Five core system capacities: 
		- anticipation
		- absorption
		- adaptation
		- recovery
		- learning


Risk-based decision making:
1. Choosing an alternative which optimizes some criteria reflecting preferences, uncerKtainties, and risk treatment option performance.
2. A process comprising formal risk and decision analysis followed by subjective expert review (evaluation) resulting in a decision.

- **Cost-benefit analysis**
- **Expected utility theory**

# Week 4 - Safety/Security Culture & Performance Management

![[61405b481cd9cae7de88680ce63dc781af5e47c3bbd798d06173ae965bd3dc37.png]]
- Risk = Effect of uncertainty on objectives (ISO 31000). Includes both **negative risks** (threats) and **positive risks** (opportunities).

### Risk Quantification
- Formula: R=L×C (Likelihood × Consequences).
- Risk can be influenced by factors like **exposure time, prevention, and protection**


**==KPABC==** cyclic model:
- **Knowledge** -> **Perception** -> **Attitude** -> Behaviour -> Consequences


## Human Factors & Errors
a very large concept

Human Error:
- **Skill**-based behaviour errors
	- slips of action
	- lapses of memory
- **Rule**-based behaviour errors
- **Knowledge**-based behaviour errors
- **Violation errors** (deliberately break an operational rule or procedure)
	- Routine violations
	- Situational violations
	- Exceptional violations
![[104a00e8078aa9d746699df905b335be3012c70734f447bfb1fb9b4989eccd68.png]]


## Safety Climate and Culture

- **==TEAM== Model** (==Egg== model): Integrates human, technological, procedural, and organizational domains.

How to achieve a safety culture?
- **==PDCA==** applied to risk management
	- **Plan** (policy development/planning of measures and actions)
	- **Do** (structures and responsibilities/training and awareness/etc)
	- **Check** (measurements and analyses/registrations and audits/etc)
	- **Act** (carry out improvement actions/revise and adjust)
	
- **==IDEAL S&S==** model
	![[b915b7a83d604a333f12c4d07fa7e4cd43dd5b7abed8d0dfaff0c83a2cd41d5a.png]]


### Performance Management (PM)

- Three types of **indicators**:
    - **Management** (proactive, “with what means?”)
    - **Process** (proactive, “how?”)
    - **Result** (reactive, “what?”)
    
- Indicators should be **SMART**:
	- Specific and clearly defined
	- Measurable
	- Achievable
	- Relevant
	- Time bound


**Conclusion**: A combination of
- the TEAM model of safety culture,
- the IDEAL S&S model, and
- performance management
leads to the gradual optimization of safety within any organisation.


**Five Golden Rules for Accident Prevention**:
1. Top management commitment to safety as a **profit driver**.
2. **Questioning** attitude and **situational** awareness.
3. Effective **communication** and transparent decision-making.
4. **Redundancy** in critical tasks and systems.
5. Regular human and technological **maintenance.**



# Week 5 - Risk Treatment & Micro-economics
---How to improve decision-making for managing risks

## Risk Treatment
- Risk **reduction**:
	- Risk **avoidance** (inherent safety or design-based safety)
	- Risk **control** (prevention, protection, mitigation)
- Risk acceptance:
	- Risk **retention** (conscious or unconscious)
	- Risk **transfer** (insurance)


### Risk Avoidance - Inherent safety or design-based safety
**Principles:** 
- Intensification *(higher density->smaller volume)*
- Substitution
- Attenuation by moderation *(use lower temperature/pressure)*
- Attenuation by limitation of effects *(isolation devices)*
- Simplification


### Risk Control
Goal of risk control methods:
- Occurence
- Severity

Risk Control Process in 10 Steps:
- Build a multidisciplinary team *(innocent view)*
- Identify and define the risks to be reduced
- Analyse the process and operating procedures. Establish the **criteria** for the decision making. 
- Generate ideas by brainstorming
- Use the established criteria to support the evaluation
- Evaluate all alternatives
- Retain risk control alternative on criteria
- Implementation of controls or measure
- Information and training (Communication)
- Evaluate the new situation


- **Prevention**: lowering the probability before sth. happens
- **Protection and mitigation**: reduce the consequences, severity or development of a disaster.

- **Safety Barriers** (active/passive devices): ![[098fce97b296181cfe6e924a40f6f9b409d6f0757cc9bf482b2e126a85aa01e4.png]]


**The bowtie metaphor** - management delivery systems
![[b322706cb45106a3a112ba882428e984ac051c8ef32611859b5a3e2d777350c7.png]]


**Risk transfer**: contractual transfer of the risk financing, essentially insurance
- **Risk financing** by retention (auto financing), finance planning of potential losses by your own resources.
- Alternative Risk. The **==Alternative Risk Transfer (ART)==** solutions comprise both elements of auto financing and contractual transfer and so cannot be classified in any of the above categories.


**Conclusion**:
Three specific steps are involved in the treatment of risk:
1. Identification of potential measures under the prevention, preparedness, response and recovery domains.
2. Evaluation and selection of measures.
3. Planning and implementation of chosen measures.

Risk treatment is hence described as **a selection and implementation process** of measures which are destined to reduce (negative) risks.



==**S.T.O.P.== Principle**:
- Strategic
- Technical
- Organizational
- Personal

- Acting at the source / interface / target

## Risk Review
- Safety is a **state** (of the feeling/mind or real) of a person, a situation, a machine, and the alike. Safety **depends on the perspective** from which one looks at the state. Many states are thinkable, and they don't tell anything about the consequences, probabilities, measures of states. Moreover, states change all the time and the description of states doesn't allow to **quantify them**. 
- Risk is **the effect of uncertainty on achieving objectives**. Risks consist of hazards/likelihood, exposure, profits/losses. 
- Quantify risk:$$R_i=K_i\cdot G_i^a$$
- **Reality** as it happens, **is actually a continuous expected value of** **summated scenarios** all having a certain likelihood to happen and thereby leading to certain consequences. 

Different types of risk:
1. **Small risks** - occupational risks with small consequences and high likelihood
2. **Major risks** - disaster risks with major consequences and very low likelihood
3. **Never seen risks** - black swan risks with extremely large consequences and extremely low likelihood *(an extremum of type 2 risk)*



## Decision-making including Micro-economics

- **Expected Value**: Measures average outcome of scenarios
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Evaluates investment profitability
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** & **Payback Period (PBP)**
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** & **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
- **Hypothetical Benefits (HB)**: Avoided losses from non-events
- **Disproportion Factor (DF)**: Tests if safety investment is disproportionate


### Psychological & Ethical Aspects
- **Loss Aversion**: Tendency to avoid losses over acquiring gains
	*We do not gamble with gains, while we tend to gamble with losses*
- **Ethical Risk Formula**: Incorporates equity, fairness, voluntariness
- **ALARP
