# Background

## Why do we need safety

- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
	1. Physiological needs
	2. Safety needs
	3. Sense of belonging and love
	4. Esteem
	5. Self-actualisation
	-Safety is a **basic need** and a human right. 
	-Ensuring the safety of the public is an ethical responsibility

- Safety:
	The state of being protected from recognized hazards that are likely to cause harm. 
- Hazard:
	Potential for an activity, condition, or substance to cause harm, damage, or adverse consequences under certain circumstances.
- Harm:
	Injury or damage to the health of the people, or damage to property or the environment.

## Hazardous activities
---Activities that may result in a release, fire, explosion at a hazardous installation, involving hazardous substances that has the potential to cause harm to human health, environment or property. 

- Why we commit to hazardous activities:
	1. Chemicals can be toxic, combustible, or explosive
	2. Accidents can cause long-lasting environmental and societal impact, detrimental to human health, or assets and goods
	3. Industrial growth relies on hazardous activities
	4. Energy supply relies on hazardous activities
	5. Almost everything we use depends on hazardous activities
	
- The Challenge:
	Private profits <-> Public hazards <-> Majority benefits <-> Exposed few
	
	Safety = ==Trust + Legitimacy + Tolerance==
	
- Characteristic of safety:
	- not static, depends on **tolerance** for harm *(children car seats)*
	- evolves reactively
		Hazardous event -> reaction -> learn -> change


## Evolution of Safety:
Safety discipline: 
No safety -> **Hazard awareness & Recognition of the need for safety** -> **Legislation & Research & Implementation** -> Safer

No safety -> **Prescriptive safety -> Performance-based safety** -> Integrated safety and security / Resilience

### Early Days – 1960: ==“Concerns and Catastrophes”==
- Challenges: 
	-Rapid growth of inventories
	-Stored energy and toxic release risks remain largely unrecognized
- Gaps:
	-No legislation on process safety
	-No formal hazard analysis, process safety methods, or metrics
	-Decisions driven by intuition
	
### 1960 – 1974: ==“Awareness and Mobilisation”==
- Challenges:
	-Rapid growth of large-scale petrochemical and LPG *(Liquid Petroleum Gas)* facilities
	-Higher pressure, inventories, and complex piping network
	-Limited understanding of runaway reaction energy and BLEVEs *(Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion)*
- Gaps:
	-Hardly any legislation on process safety
	-No formal hazard analysis, process safety methods, or metrics
	-Decisions driven by intuition
	
- What happened:
	-Regulatory responses
	-Industrial initiatives
	-Research and academia
	
- Overview of responses:
	-Introduction of new safety regulations and codes
	-Industry-wide safety initiatives and symposia
	-Integration of reliability engineering into chemical industries
	-Formalization of structured risk analysis methods (HAZOP, FTA, FMEA)
	-Inclusion of new hazard scenarios in safety planning and insurance
	-Company-level design rules for emergency protection and isolation
	
- The rise and dominance of ==prescriptive safety==:
	- **Rule-based approach**: safety achieved through strict compliance with detailed regulations, codes, and design standards
	- **Minimum requirements** (that are still in existence): emphasis on “safe enough” thresholds, not on optimizing or balancing the potential harm of the hazards.
	- **Design- and technology-focused**: rules concentrated on equipment standards, facility layouts, and engineering specifications
	- **Uniformity**: one-size-fits-all requirements applied across the industry, with little to no consideration of context or achieved safety performance
	- **Goal**: ensure baseline safety and predictability in industrial design and construction.
- Gaps and shortcomings of ==prescriptive safety==:
	- **Reactive**, not adaptive: rules often lagged technological and industrial developments.
	- **Compliance over outcomes**: “Checklist” culture rather than achieved safety performance.
	- **Rigid and inflexible**: difficult to adapt to novel hazards, new technologies, or complex systems.
	- **Encouraged minimalism**: companies meeting the minimum safety standards are assumed to be safe.
	- **Blind spots**: human factors, organizational aspects, and systemic interactions are largely overlooked.

### 1974 – 1996: ==“Industrial Expansion & Disasters”==
- Challenges:
	-Rapid scale-up of refineries, LNG/LPG storage, and offshore oil
	-Societal (potential) impacts now extend well beyond the fence
	-Societal expectations regarding process safety
- Gaps:
	-No integrated major hazard legislation
	-Minimal quantitative risk tools for siting and escalation
	-Mismanaged maintenance, MOC, and human factors
	
- Overview of responses:
	-Expansion of major accident regulations at national and international levels
	-Introduction of structured process safety management systems
	-Adoption of inherently safer design principles
	-Development of new analytical and barrier management models (bow-tie and tripod)
	-Formalization of process safety as a discipline in research and education
	-Integration of organizational and systemic perspectives (accident theories, reliability, human factors)
	-Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is adapted to chemical process industries
	-The Dutch Coloured books by TNO
	
- The rise and dominance of ==Performance-based safety==:
	-Shift from rules and prescriptions → **proof of safety performance**
	-Operators must **demonstrate** that hazards, their potential consequences, and their frequency **are controlled**
	-**Risk concept** at its core
	-Implementation of risk-based safety management systems
	
- ==Performance-based safety== and **risk**:
	-Prescriptive safety = compliance with regulations, standards, and codes
	-Performance-based safety = demonstrate achieved safety
	-Safety cannot be measured (not static, It's a state, requires a proxy to help evaluate it = risk)
	
- How ==risk== is used to demonstrate safety performance:
	-Risk **connects hazards with the tolerability** of potential harm
	-Tolerability is judged **against what society values** (health, environment, economy)
	-Making risk actionable involves two steps: (**Risk Assessment**)
		- **Risk analysis**: identify hazards and estimate their likelihood and consequences
		- **Risk evaluation**: compare results against tolerability criteria

- From risk assessment to ==Risk-based Safety Management==:
	Risk Assessment + Decisions *(how we act on the results)* 
	= Risk Management → how operators ensure safety in practice
	
- From risk management to ==Risk Governance==:
	-**Operators/private sector**: manage risk of their installations and operations
	-**Public authorities**: set acceptance criteria, grant permits to build and operate, review performance, and enforce regulations
	-**Risk governance**: ensures that management practices deliver safety at a tolerable level for society
	 = Risk Assessment + Risk Management + **Risk Communication**
	
- What is risk:
	Risk refers to uncertainty about severity of the events and consequences (or outcomes) of an activity with respect to something that humans values. (Aven and Renn 2009)
- Characteristics of risk:
	- includes desirable and unwanted outcomes
	- concerned with uncertainties not probabilities
	- concerned with what is at stake and not specific consequences
	
- Gaps and shortcomings of ==performance-based safety==:
	-Highly dependant on the **quality of risk assessment**
		-Multiplicity of scenarios
		-Lacking historical data
		-Incomplete consequence
		-Human decision-makers
	-Could lead to **overlook**ed complexity, uncertainty, and rare events
	-**Risk acceptance criteria** are subject to interpretation and ethical dilemmas
	-Requires **strong regulators and authorities** to review and challenge safety cases
	-**Still reactive**: ==accidents reveal blind spots== (culture, management, and unprecedented hazards)

### 1996 – 2012: ==“Risk, culture, resilience”==
- Challenges:
	-Aging assets, third party involvement, tighter economic margins
	-The impact of leading indicators of safety: management, culture, and human factors
	-First clear signs of increased deliberate physical and cyber threats to process plants
- Gaps:

	-AI twins and autonomous control, data-trust issues
	-OT cyber-attacks & ransomware on critical assets
	-Climate shocks(flood, freeze, wildfire) threaten plants(NaTech)
	-Aging large-scale sites under cost-driven deferral
	-Supply-chain risks and geopolitical unrest
- Gaps:
	-Standards lag rapidly evolving processes
	-Physical and Cyber security risks still outside mainstream risk assessments(PLA/LOPA/...)
	-Sparse sensors -> poor data for digital twins/ML
	-Climate risks are rarely built into design&QRA
	-Lacking and lagging workforce to face process-safety cyber challenges
	-Fragmented governance across safety, security, and ESG
	
- Overview of responses:
	-Expansion of regulation to include cyber, resilience, and governance (Seveso III, CER, NIS2, TSA directives, etc)
	-Integration of digital technologies into safety (digital twins, predictive maintenance, cyber-HAZOP)
	-Development of Safety-II and resilience engineering approaches
