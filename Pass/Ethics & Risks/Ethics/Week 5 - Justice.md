# Rawls - Veil of Ignorance

## Original Position
- A purely hypothetical situation: imagining designing society from scratch
- Social justice = what reasonable people would agree to in such a situation
- People are assumed to be:
  - Free and equal
  - Want to do well for themselves
  - Prepared to adhere to reasonable terms of cooperation if others do too
  - Choose from a menu of views about justice

## Veil of Ignorance
- **Hidden facts**:
  - Demographic facts (gender, race, wealth, etc.)
  - Facts about society
  - Your "view of the good" (values, preferences)
- ==**Criticism**: Leads us to ignore the real world too much==
- ==**Advantage**: Helps consider things from different points of view==

## Primary Goods
- Money and other resources
- Basic rights and freedoms
- The social bases of self-respect

## Maximin Principle
- We should ensure that the worst-off people in society do as well as possible

## Rawls' Principles of Justice
- ==**First Principle**==:
  - Equal basic liberties for all
  - Everyone is a **moral equal** in society
- ==**Second Principle**== (Social and economic **inequalities** must):
  - Be attached to offices open to all under fair equality of opportunity
  - Benefit the least-advantaged members most (**Difference Principle**)


## Criticisms

### Ownership and Rights (==Robert Nozick==)
- Need to consider history of how goods came to be owned
- Concept of "self-ownership": wrong to force work or property transfer
- Counter-argument: Ability to work depends on society, so not everything produced comes solely from individual

### Identity and Neutrality (Communitarian Philosophers)
- Justice cannot be decided abstractly - must consider local culture
- Veil ignores important defining features of people
- Societies may be attached to particular values
- Rawls aims for neutral decision-making between competing groups
- Possible solution: Give special place to values while protecting dissenters

### Ideal Justice? (Race & Gender Scholars)
- Purposely ignores past and present injustices
- Results in incomplete theory that doesn't address existing injustice ("non-ideal justice")
- Theory focused only on ideal ignores pressing real-world issues


# Levin - Affirmative Action
## Definition &  Goal of AA
- Policies designed to increase opportunities for historically excluded or underrepresented groups.
- Aims to redress past injustices, counteract systemic bias, and promote diversity in education, employment, etc.
- Corrects unfair treatment where people face disadvantages through no fault of their own.

## Key Arguments & Concepts

### The Fence Analogy
- Three children of different heights try to watch a baseball game over a fence.
- Equal treatment (giving each one box) doesn’t work—the shortest still can’t see.
- Equitable treatment (giving boxes based on need) allows all to see.
- Ideal solution: remove the systemic barrier (the fence) entirely.
- Reality: barriers exist that prevent people from achieving due to who they are.

### Systemic Inequalities
- **De dicto**: Written into law or policy (e.g., segregation laws).
- **De facto**: Occurs in practice, even without explicit laws (e.g., wage gaps).

### Legal Context: Regents of the University of California v. Bakke
- First major test of affirmative action.
- Quota systems ruled **unconstitutional**—applicants must be treated as individuals, not group members.
- Race may still be considered to promote diversity, but rigid quotas are not allowed.
- Policies are justified only while systemic discrimination persists.

### Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ)
- Traits genuinely required for a role.
- Example: Muggsy Bogues (5’3’’ NBA player)—ability to play basketball is a BFOQ; height is not.
- Affirmative action should only apply to candidates who **meet justifiable BFOQs**.
- These candidates are qualified—just not necessarily the strongest.

### Levin’s Stance
- Unjust discrimination still exists and should be corrected.
- Affirmative action promotes societal fairness.
- Beneficiaries may indeed merit the position most when context is considered.

## Q&A

### 1. Does affirmative action make decision procedures more just?
Yes. It addresses de facto discrimination and systemic barriers, ensuring minimally qualified candidates from underrepresented groups get a fair chance. Equality (same treatment) is not the same as equity (fair outcomes).

### 2. When should affirmative action be used?
When:
- A group is underrepresented.
- There’s no justifiable reason for underrepresentation (e.g., no valid BFOQ).
- De facto discrimination is likely.
- Candidates meet minimum qualifications (BFOQs).

### 3. Should quotas be allowed to counter unconscious bias?
- **Against**: Quotas violate individual treatment and are unconstitutional. They risk reverse discrimination.
- **For**: If unconscious bias is pervasive and softer measures fail, quotas may be the only effective tool for equity.
- In conclusion, while the intent behind quotas—to forcefully counter unconscious bias—is understandable, they are a blunt instrument that often creates new forms of injustice. **A more nuanced approach** that ==considers background as a factor in an individualized assessment== is a more legally and ethically defensible way to achieve the same goals of fairness and diversity.



# Robots in the Workplace
--- Jilles Smids, Sven Nyholm, Hannah Berkers

## Introduction & Motivation
*   Investigates the impact of workplace robotization on **meaningful work**, a previously underexplored topic.
*   Contrasts common fears (technological unemployment, loss of dignity) with potential positive outcomes.
*   Importance: Meaningful work leads to higher job satisfaction, well-being, and is argued by some to be a matter of justice.

## Key Concepts

### 2.1. What are Robots?
*   Embodied machines with sensors, actuators, and some degree of AI.
*   Types:
    *   **Preprogrammed:** Perform well-defined tasks (e.g., car assembly).
    *   **Tele-operated:** Controlled remotely by humans (e.g., drones, surgery bots).
    *   **Autonomous:** Sense and act with purpose (e.g., delivery bots).
    *   **Augmenting:** Integrated with the human body (e.g., exoskeletons).

### 2.2. What is Meaningful Work?
*   Work that is "personally significant and worthwhile".
*   Based on a synthesis of philosophy and organizational psychology literature, the authors identify **five key aspects** of meaningful work.

## The Five Aspects of Meaningful Work

### 3.1. Pursuing a Purpose
*   Work is meaningful when it is significant, purposeful, and contributes to a worthy cause or "something bigger".
*   Involves both the *process* of striving and the *outcome* achieved (e.g., healing patients).

### 3.2. Social Relationships
*   Positive social relations at work (sense of belonging, cooperation, shared identity) contribute to meaningfulness.

### 3.3. Exercising Skills and Self-Development
*   Developing, exercising, and acquiring complex skills fosters a sense of competence, self-efficacy, and personal growth.

### 3.4. Self-Esteem and Recognition
*   Work enhances self-worth through accomplishments and contributions.
*   Recognition from others (colleagues, managers, society) further reinforces meaningfulness.

### 3.5. Autonomy
*   Freedom, participation in decisions, and opportunities for "job crafting" (shaping one's tasks and perceptions of work).

## Impact of Robotization: Threats & Opportunities

| Aspect of Meaningful Work        | Threat of Robotization                                                                                                           | Opportunity of Robotization                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Pursuing a Purpose**        | Robots take over the most challenging tasks, making workers **feel they contribute less** (e.g., radiologists vs. AI diagnosis). | Robots handle tedious tasks, allowing humans to **focus on core purposes** (e.g., patient care). Teaming up with robots can lead to **better outcomes**.                           |
| **2. Social Relationships**      | Replacing human coworkers reduces social interaction, leading to isolation and diminished shared agency.                         | Robots designed as **team members** can provide a sense of belonging (e.g., "Boomer" the military robot). Freeing up **time for more human interaction** (e.g., teacher as coach). |
| **3. Skills & Self-Development** | Deskilling: Human skills become obsolete if robots take over complex tasks.                                                      | Robots require humans to **maintain skills and learn new, complex ones for oversight and operation** (e.g., supervising AI, maintaining piloting skills).                          |
| **4. Self-Esteem & Recognition** | If robots do the most difficult tasks, human self-worth and social recognition may diminish.                                     | Teaming up with robots can lead to **skill expansion and better results**, increasing recognition and self-esteem (e.g., teacher using AI).                                        |
| **5. Autonomy**                  | Strict protocols, monitoring, data collection, and AI opacity can reduce human judgment, decision-making, and job crafting.      | Controlling robots can **increase responsibility and autonomy** (e.g., Amazon overseer Nissa Scott). Robots can help workers achieve their aims more effectively.                  |

## Ethical Issues
*   If society has an obligation to provide meaningful work, it has a derivative obligation to **==promote meaning-enhancing robotization and inhibit meaning-threatening robotization.==**
*   **Key Debate:** Is it ethically problematic to design robots to be perceived as colleagues? Contrasts:
    *   **Joanna Bryson‘s "Robots as Slaves":** Robots are property; design should not elicit anthropomorphizing responses.
    *   **David Gunkel's "Relational Turn" &  John Danaher's "Ethical Behaviorism":** We should view robots based on our interactions with them; if they replicate human collegial behavior, we are justified in treating them as such.
*   **Trade-offs:** Robot-friendly workplaces (predictable, data-rich) may conflict with human-friendly workplaces (personalized, private).

## Concluding Remarks & Recommendations
*   Robotization's impact is **not predetermined**; it depends on implementation.
*   The framework helps analyze the effects on meaningful work.
*   **Recommendations:**
    1.  Conduct empirical case studies in robotized workplaces.
    2.  Research the overall effect on the *availability* of meaningful work, not just job numbers.
    3.  Foster philosophical debate on the moral obligations of the state and businesses regarding robotization and meaningful work.
