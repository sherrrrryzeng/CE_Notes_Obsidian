## 2.1 Introduction - Case: Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Project

- Engineers bypassed their immediate superiors to report safety concerns.
- They lost their jobs and later accepted an out-of-court settlement.
- **IEEE Professional Code**  - _“safety, health, and welfare of the public.”_

## 2.2 Codes of Conduct
- Definition:
	Codes in which organisations provide guidelines for responsible behaviour of their members. These are often intended as **an addition to legal requirements**.

 - Two Types of code of conduct for Engineers:
	- **Professional Codes**
	- **Corporate Codes**

- Reasons for Formulation:
	- To increase moral awareness
	- To articulate moral norms and values of a profession or company
	- To stimulate ethical discussion
	- To increase accountability to the outside world
	- To improve the image of a profession or company


### Three Types (based on objectives)
1. **Aspirational Code** – expresses the moral values of a profession or company to the outside world.
2. **Advisory Code** – helps individuals exercise moral judgment in concrete situations, based on general values and norms. (Most professional codes.)
3. **Disciplinary Code** – ensures that behavior of professionals or employees meets certain values and norms. (Common in corporate codes.)
---


### Professional Codes
- Definition: Guidelines for practicing a profession, formulated by a professional society.
- History: Early codes → Post-WWII → Modern professional codes

- Three Domains:
	1. **Integrity and Competent Professional Practice**
	- Core of all professional codes
	- Avoid conflicts of interest
	
	2. **Obligations Towards Clients and Employers**
	- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive information
	
	3. **Social Responsibility and Public Obligations**
	- Protect safety, health, environment, sustainable development, and public welfare


### Corporate Codes
- Definition: Voluntary commitments by companies or associations, setting values, standards, and principles for corporate conduct.

- Three Types:
1. **Stakeholder Statutes** – responsibility towards stakeholders
    - ==Stakeholders==: consumers, employees, investors, society, environment, competitors, suppliers
    - Principles: transparency, honesty, fairness
    
2. **Value Statements**
    - ==Mission statement==
    - ==Core values==: teamwork, responsibility, open communication, creativity, customer orientation, flexibility, efficiency, professionalism, loyalty
    
3. **Codes of Conduct (Norms & Rules)**
    - Topics: acceptance of gifts, fraud, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, theft, corruption, bribery, discrimination, respect, sexual harassment



## 2.3 Possibilities and Limitations of Codes of Conduct

### Codes of Conduct and Self-Interest
- Risk of ==**window-dressing**== *(e.g., Google in China)*
- May neglect legitimate interests of other stakeholders

### Vagueness and Contradictions
- Vagueness allows multiple interpretations
- Inconsistencies can exist both within and between codes *(e.g., NSPE, FEANI, IEEE)*

### Can Ethics Be Codified?
- Arguments:
	1. Ethics requires individual moral judgment, not blind obedience
	- Disciplinary codes are prescriptive and enforceable → legally/morally binding
    
	2. Codes of conduct is not morally binding
	- but remind professionals of responsibilities
    
	3. Some assume morality can be expressed in universal rules
	- Sound judgment requires attention to situational particularities


### Can Codes of Conduct Be Lived By?
- Problem: Whistleblowers often face weak legal protection

- Limits to confidentiality duties:
    - Freedom of speech is legally protected
    - Certain information must be made public by law
    - Professional duty and public interest may override secrecy
    
- Initiatives to improve situation:
    - Legal reforms to protect whistleblowers
    - Companies allowing limited right to inform the public
    - Professional associations offering legal support


### Enforcement
- **Professional Codes**
    - Rarely enforced
    - Advisory codes - not intended for enforcement
    - Lack legal status and sanctions
    
    - Case: Engineer registration in US & Australia – _John Tozer removed from ACEA for openly criticizing others’ work_
    
- **Corporate Codes**
    - Lack legal status but easier to enforce
    - Can be externally audited
    - Exposed to external criticism 
    
- Case: Brent Spar *- forced to stop because of environmental organisations*



## 2.4 Codes of Conduct in an International Context

### Global Codes for Multinationals
- Linked to multinational corporations and foreign direct investment → voluntary codes

- Three Major Global Codes:
	1. Caux Round Table Principles
	2. OECD Guidelines for Multinational Companies
	3. United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Principles
	
- Case: Shell in Nigeria and the Ogoni People



### Global Codes for Engineers
- Require continued effort to respect and understand cultural differences
- Seek consistency despite cultural variation    
- Assume reason as a valid decision-making tool

# Chapter 2: Q&A
# Questions & Answers: Codes of Conduct

## 1. The Software Engineering Code of Ethics…
The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice of the Association for Computing Machinery states that "The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur. However, even in this generality, the Code provides support for software engineers and managers of software engineers who need to take positive action in a specific case by documenting the ethical stance of the profession. The Code provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The Code helps to define those actions that are ethically improper to request of a software engineer or teams of software engineers. The Code is not simply for adjudicating the nature of questionable acts; it also 39 has an important educational function. As this Code expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it is a means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals about the ethical obligations of all software engineers.” Is this code aspirational, advisory, or disciplinary? Explain your answer.

This code is primarily **advisory**. It emphasizes adaptability, support in specific cases, and an educational function. It documents the profession’s ethical stance, provides guidance for moral judgment, and helps identify ethically improper actions. It is not strictly prescriptive or enforced with sanctions, which distinguishes it from disciplinary codes.

---

## 2. Give an example of a situation in which you have a professional responsibility to do something but not a legal responsibility.
An engineer may have a **professional responsibility** to disclose safety risks in a project (e.g., a structural flaw in a bridge), even when **no legal requirement** exists to report such concerns. The duty comes from the professional code of protecting public safety, not from statutory law.

---

## 3. What is meant by “a code is nothing, coding is everything”?
It means that a code of conduct has little value if it only exists on paper. What truly matters is how the code is **implemented, interpreted, and lived by** in professional practice. The emphasis is on actual behavior, not formal statements.

---

## 4. What are the most important objectives of professional codes of conduct?
- Increase awareness and sensitivity to moral issues  
- Assist in analyzing and judging ethical dilemmas  
- Promote accountability to the public and profession  
- Provide guidance for responsible decision-making  
- Enhance the public image of the profession  

---

## 5. Why is enforcement an explicit objective for disciplinary codes? Why is enforcement often difficult to obtain for professional engineering codes of conduct?
- **Disciplinary codes**: Enforcement is explicit because they aim to ensure compliance by sanctioning misconduct.  
- **Professional codes**: Enforcement is difficult because most engineering associations lack legal authority. Membership is often voluntary, and the harshest sanction (loss of membership) rarely affects the ability to practice as an engineer.

---

## 6. What are corporate codes? Discuss three objections to and/or shortcomings of corporate codes.
**Corporate codes**: Voluntary commitments by companies that set values, standards, and principles for employee and corporate behavior.  

**Objections/shortcomings**:  
1. **Window-dressing**: Codes used for image-building rather than genuine change.  
2. **Vagueness**: Broad, aspirational language may be unclear in practical situations.  
3. **Contradictions**: Conflicts may arise between corporate profit motives and stated social responsibilities.

---

## 7. What are the two arguments of Milton Friedman’s criticism of corporate social responsibility? Give some objections against these arguments.
**Friedman’s arguments**:  
1. Companies are responsible only to shareholders; spending on CSR reduces shareholder profit.  
2. Corporations are not democratically elected and should not impose moral views.  

**Objections**:  
- CSR can improve long-term profitability (“ethics pays”).  
- Laws often lag behind technological change; companies may need to act responsibly beyond legal requirements.  
- Companies benefit from public trust and legitimacy, which CSR fosters.

---

## 8. Provide an argument for and an argument against the adoption of similar disciplinary law for engineers.
- **For**: Ensures accountability and protects the public by sanctioning misconduct, similar to doctors and lawyers.  
- **Against**: Engineering is highly diverse; a single disciplinary system may be impractical and restrict innovation or professional autonomy.

---

## 9. What is valuable about loyalty? What is problematic about loyalty?
- **Valuable**: Loyalty builds trust and long-term cooperation between engineers, employers, and clients.  
- **Problematic**: If interpreted as **uncritical loyalty** (placing employer’s interests above all else), it may lead to ignoring public safety or ethical obligations. **Critical loyalty**, which balances employer interests with professional ethics, is preferable.

## 10. Critically evaluate the merits of the UK’s Public Interest Disclosure Act conditions…
To gain protection of the UK’s Public Interest Disclosure Act, those who reveal organizational malpractices have to satisfy a number of conditions that witnesses in other criminal investigations do not have to satisfy, e.g., deriving no financial gain from the case and not having been involved in the crime at any stage. Critically evaluate the merits of these conditions, Compare them also with the guidelines for whistle-blowing mentioned in Chapter 1.

**Merits**: Conditions (e.g., no financial gain, no involvement in crime) aim to prevent abuse of whistleblowing protections and ensure credibility.  
**Criticism**: These conditions may set an unfairly high bar compared to other criminal witnesses, discouraging legitimate disclosures.  
**Comparison with guidelines in Chapter 1**: The text suggests whistleblowing should be a last resort, but requiring extra burdens may undermine protection for employees acting in the public interest.

---

## 11. Look for a professional code of conduct in your own area:
a. Do you recognize the three general content areas mentioned in the text in this code? 
b. Is the code vague at same points? Where? 
c. Are their potential contradictions between the provisions of the code? Does the code contain provisions to deal with these contradictions?
d. Are there any provisions in the code that are impossible to live by? Which ones? 
e. Do you agree which the professional responsibility set out in the code? Are you missing anything?
*(This requires applying to a specific field. Example: NSPE Code of Ethics)*  

a. Yes, the three areas are present: competence & integrity, obligations to employers/clients, and social responsibility.  
b. Some provisions are vague, e.g., “serve the public interest” without clear procedures.  
c. Potential contradictions: confidentiality vs. duty to warn the public. Few mechanisms exist to resolve them.  
d. Whistleblowing obligations may be impossible to live by due to employer retaliation.  
e. Overall, the responsibilities are reasonable, but stronger protection for whistleblowers could be added.

---

## 12. Look for a corporate code of an engineering company.
In what respects are the responsibilities of engineers that are articulated in this code different from the responsibilities articulated in professional codes (like the code of the NSPE)? Is this code conflicting at certain points with, for example, the 40 professional code of the NSPE? If there is a conflict what code should, in your view, take precedence and why?

- **Differences**: Corporate codes emphasize shareholder value, reputation, and compliance with company policy, while professional codes (e.g., NSPE) stress public welfare.  
- **Conflicts**: A corporate focus on profit may conflict with professional duties to protect safety or disclose hazards.  
- **Precedence**: Professional codes should take precedence because they uphold public safety and ethical obligations beyond corporate interests.

---

## 13. Do you agree that engineers have a responsibility for human rights?
Yes. Engineers not only must **avoid human rights violations** (e.g., refusing to design systems for oppressive use) but also should **actively enhance human rights** by ensuring their projects contribute positively to society (e.g., accessibility, environmental justice).

---

## 14. Draft a code of conduct to cover e-communications(e-mail, Web use and so on). Explain and justify your proposed code.
**Proposed Code for E-Communications**  
1. Use e-communications responsibly and lawfully.  
2. Maintain confidentiality and protect sensitive data.  
3. Avoid harassment, discrimination, or offensive content.  
4. Do not use company systems for personal gain or illegal activity.  
5. Respect intellectual property and copyright.  
6. Report misuse or breaches promptly.  

**Justification**: These rules balance professional integrity, security, and respect for others while ensuring compliance with organizational and ethical standards.

---

## 15. Principle of scientific founded judgement…
One of the principles for a global code of conduct for engineers mentioned by Luegenbiehl is the principle of scientific founded judgement. What do you think that Luegenbiehl means with extraneous factors? Would considerations of safety or human welfare count as extraneous factors that should not influence engineering decisions?

**Extraneous factors**: Non-technical influences such as political pressure, financial interests, or personal gain.  
**Safety and human welfare** are **not extraneous**; they are central to ethical engineering and must influence decisions.

## 16. Boeing engineers as FAA inspectors…
The US government allows employees of aircraft manufacturers like Boeing to serve as inspectors for the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) that is responsible for regulating the aircraft industry and doing safety and quality inspections. What would be the reasons for the US government to allow this? Is this a conflict of interest? Would it be unethical for an engineer employed by Boeing also to act as inspector for the FAA?

**Reasons for allowance**: Leverage technical expertise, reduce costs, and ensure industry-specific knowledge in inspections.  
**Conflict of interest**: Yes, because engineers may prioritize company interests over regulatory impartiality.  
**Ethical evaluation**: It would be **unethical** if engineers compromised independence. To avoid this, strong safeguards and transparency are needed to maintain public trust.
