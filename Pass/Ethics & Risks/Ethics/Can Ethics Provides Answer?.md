## 1. Introduction
- Many doubt whether ethics can provide answers like science.
- Doubts arise because of widespread disagreement on moral issues.
- Some conclude ethics is just opinion with no objective truth.


## 2. Arguments for Skepticism

### (1) Cultural Relativism
- **Claim**: Different cultures = different moral codes → no universal truths.
- **Alasdair MacIntyre**: In modern ethics moral language has lost its rational foundation, so ethical judgments often amount to little more than expressions of personal attitude.
- **Aristotle**: (Slavery) Held the sensible view that people in different traditions have enough in common, in virtue of their shared humanity, to make the achievement of common norms a realistic goal. 
- **Rachels’ critique**:  
  - Disagreement ≠ no truth (science also has disagreement).  
  - Strict relativism prevents condemning practices like slavery.

### (2) Psychological Accounts (Freud, Skinner)
- **Freud**:  
  - Morality learned via parental rewards/punishments.  
  - Internalized as the “superego,” forming conscience.  
- **Skinner (behaviorism)**:  
  - Morality = what is positively reinforced.  
  - “Good” = rewarded behavior.  
- **Rachels’ response**:  
  - Explains origins of beliefs, not their validity.  
	  *-The manner of the acquisition of beliefs is logically independent of their status as objectively true or false.* 
  - Like history: learning involves psychology, but truth remains objective.

### (3) The Argument from Proof
- **Claim**: Ethics lacks scientific proof → no objective truth.  
- **Rachels’ response**:  
  - Ethics uses reasons/arguments, not lab experiments.  
	  -*we can support our judgments with good reasons, and provide explanations of why these reasons matter, and show that the case on the other side is weak.*
  - Some issues (abortion) are complex, but others (random killing) admit consensus.  
  - Failure to convince ≠ absence of argument (bias, self-interest can block agreement).

### (4)Understanding what the world is like

- **Core Idea**: Moral judgments are not independent of facts; they rely on an understanding of what the world is like.  
- **Aristotle’s Influence**:  
	-  Understanding the nature of things reveals their purposes (telos).  From this, one could derive what is “good” or “ought” for them.  
	- **Anthropocentric view**: Plants exist for animals, and animals for humans.
- **Examples**:  Deciding whether animal experimentation is ethical requires knowing whether animals can feel pain.  
- **Modern Challenge**:  Science has undermined Aristotle’s teleology, but facts still matter.  We must combine empirical facts with moral reflection.  


### (5)Emotivism mid the Eclipse of Ethics
- **David Hume**:  
	- Morality rests on sentiments/desires, not pure reason.  
	- ![[Ethics Lecture Notes#David Hume - Treatise on Human Nature]]
- **Emotivism** (20th century):  
	- *the final, fully worked out form of one of the major options in human thought, **ethical subjectivism***
	- Moral judgments = emotional expressions (“Stealing is wrong” = “Boo to stealing!”).  
- **Rachels' response**: Too extreme, but highlights emotional foundations.
	- *Charles Stevenson,  Ethics and Language*

## 3. Rachels’ Position
- Ethics ≠ mathematics: absolute proof is rare.  
- But ethics **can** provide answers:  
	- Through reasoning and justification.  
		*Ultimately the case against ethics can be answered only by demonstrating how moral problems are solvable by rational methods.*
	- By seeking **reflective equilibrium** (balance principles & intuitions).  
	- Produces the best-supported, most reasonable answers available.
