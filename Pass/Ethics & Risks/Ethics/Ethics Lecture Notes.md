# Lecture 1 - What is ethics and what is it good for?

## Problems of orientation

| Descriptive questions                    | Normative questions                     | Prescriptive questions                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| What is the case?<br>What are the facts? | What has value?<br>What is good or bad? | What ==should== be done?<br>What should we do? |
Both normative and prescriptive questions are considered as **normative** here.
Whether a sentence is descriptive or normative depends on the ==context==.


## (Social) Consequences of technology - Why we need ethics
- Technologies are **ambivalent**. They are not value neutral – they often have good and bad consequences
- The design of technologies leaves room for **choices** that can make technologies better or worse (ethically speaking).
- Technological ambivalence constitutes the **ethical responsibilities** of engineers.


### What is ethics (of technology)?
Definition:
- Ethics means thinking systematically about moral questions and exchanging arguments – to justify moral duties and responsibilities, and to find solutions for moral conflicts, dilemmas and to provide normative orientation.

Goals:
- Become sensitive and capable of identifying possible moral conflicts and take them seriously.
- To understand the contribution of technologies to these conflicts.
- Ethics as a condition for creating morally acceptable technologies.


**Ethical Argument:**
- Premises lead to Conclusion
1. **Sound argument**: An argument that is both valid and all premises are **true**.
2. **Valid argument**: An argument whose conclusion follows necessarily from its ==premises== (by way of logical necessity).
3. **Ethical argument**: Contains at least one normative premise and has a normative conclusion. 

Two **normative ethics**:
- One (or more) principles/concepts to which all moral questions can be reduced.
- Kantianism/Deontology & Utilitarianism


#### Relativism & Subjectivism
- **Relativism:**  
    The view that moral truths depend on _cultural_ or _societal_ context — there are no universal moral standards.
    - **Example:** What’s considered right in one culture (e.g., polygamy) may be wrong in another.
    - **Critique:** It promotes tolerance but makes it hard to criticize harmful practices (e.g., slavery).
    
- **Subjectivism:**  
    The idea that moral judgments are based on _individual feelings or opinions_.
    - **Example:** “Lying is wrong because _I_ disapprove of it.”
    - **Critique:** It undermines moral discussion — if morality is just personal opinion, disagreement loses meaning.
    

**Common problem:** Both relativism and subjectivism challenge the idea of objective moral truth.


#### Distinguished between morality, ethics, metaethics, and normative ethics

- **Morality:**  
    The actual _principles, rules, and values_ people live by — what a society or person considers right or wrong.
    > Everyday moral beliefs and practices.
    
- **Ethics:**  
    The _philosophical reflection_ on morality — asking _why_ certain actions are right or wrong.
    > The study of moral reasoning.
    
- **Metaethics:**  
    The _study of the nature of moral language and truth_ — asking what “good,” “right,” or “wrong” _mean_ and whether moral facts exist.
    > Example: “Are moral values objective or subjective?”
    
- **Normative ethics:**  
    The branch of ethics that develops _theories or principles_ to guide moral behavior.
    > Example: Utilitarianism, Deontology, Virtue Ethics.


# Lecture 2 - Ethical Theories (Deontology and Utilitarianism)

## Kantian Theory (Deontology)
### Conclusion
Deontology, particularly as developed by **Immanuel Kant**, is an ethical framework focused on the morality of ==actions== themselves rather than their consequences. Kant argued that actions are morally right if they are performed ==out of duty and follow a universal moral law==, which he called the **categorical imperative**. This imperative includes **principles** like treating others as ends in themselves (respecting their inherent worth) and only acting according to maxims that could be universal laws.


### David Hume - Treatise on Human Nature
- Moral Philosophy (Sentimentalism):
	- Moral judgments are not based on reason but on **feeling or moral sentiment**. 
	- When we call something wrong, we feel disapproval inside ourselves, instead of discovering a fact about the world.
	- *Emotivism: Morality rests on sentiments/desires, not pure reason.* 
- Is-Ought Problem:
	- Facts describe what is; morals prescribe what should be.
	- You cannot logically derive an 'ought' from an 'is'.
- Influence:
	- Immanuel Kant
	- laid the groundwork for later theories.
- The difference uses of 'ought' and 'should'
	- 'ought' from Hume - agent relative and conditional
	- 'should' from Kant - universal or absolute, and necessary
	- Example:
		- *If you want to make the old lady happy, then you ought to help her over the street*
		- *If you enjoy helping others, then you should help the old lady cross the street*

- Agent-neutral, universal and necessary duties
	- **The purely good will** – detached – or even opposed to personal preferences and from the desire to achieve certain goals – has insight into the authority of certain duties and respects those duties simply because they are duties.
	- So the action’s moral value doesn’t depend on whether what is aimed at in it is actually achieved, but **solely on the principle of the will** from which the action is done, irrespective of anything the faculty of desire may be aiming at. From what I have said it is clear that the purposes we may have in acting, and their effects as drivers of the will towards desired ends, can’t give our actions any unconditional value, any moral value.
- What actions are real duties in contrast to 'conditional duties'?
	- What makes an action right is its being performed for the sake of its conformity with the idea of a universal morality itself (no matter how you feel about that, no matter which effects the action will have in the world etc.)


## Utilitarianism

### Conclusion
Utilitarianism, founded by Jeremy Bentham and developed by John Stuart Mill, is a consequentialist ethical theory that evaluates actions based on their outcomes. The goal is to maximize happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people, often summarized as “the greatest good for the greatest number.” An action is morally right if it produces more net positive effects (pleasure or happiness) than any other action.


- What's good and interesting:
	- **Inclusivity**: expand the realm of morality. make first steps to overcome speciesism. 
	- **Simple and clear**: seemingly simple, attractive and clear. ethical dilemmas might disappear.
- Common serious misconceptions:
	- With egoism: The pleasure and happiness of your own is the same as everyone else's
	- It takes into account that the subjective of happiness

- Actual Consequentialism:
	- whether an act is morally right depends only on the actual consequences (as opposed to foreseen, foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences)
- Total Consequentialism:
	- demands aggregation so that the sum total of pleasure is highest
- Direct Consequentialism:
	- How that sum total is achieved is secondary 


# Lecture 4 - Varieties of Responsibility

### The straight rule of responsibility - John Leslie Mackie
a basic/plain notion of responsibility

- "We are responsible for all and only our **intentional actions**." --- successfully distinguish between **accidents and acts**
	- Involuntarily causal contribution does not lead to blameworthiness.
	- Example:*Jim stumbles into weird a situation, in which he is forced to make a choice: Either he shoots one person, or someone else (Pedro) will shoot 20 people. If he walks away, Pedro will shoot 20 people.*
		- The straight rule suggests that he **is responsible** whatever he does, because he acts intentionally, not accidental. 
	- but it may be a wise, justifiable, and commendable action to choose X-rather-than-Y. It may be something for which the agent **has no need to escape responsibility**, something of which he can be proud rather than ashamed.
- It does **NOT suggest** anything about how we ought to respond to those actions, or **feel about** them or whether they are right or wrong.


## Responsibility as overt action
- It gives us **a reason to respond** to whoever is responsible in a certain way. Different ethical theories evaluate these responses differently(/have different **moral acceptability** of all of these "overt practices").

### Four Goals/Foundations for over responses
1. **Retribution**: those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment, to restore justice(an eye for an eye) 
	- Backward-looking 
	- Punishment is proportionate to wrongdoing, whatever the consequences
2. **Betterment**: of the doer through punishment, rehabilitation or preventing repeating problematic behaviours.
3. **Prevention/Deterrence**: directed at other people, who might be disposed to do the same.
4. **Rectification**: Compensation for damages.

| Goals                          | Ethical Theories |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Retribution                    | Deontology       |
| Betterment/<br>Rehabilitation  | Utilitarianism   |
| Prevention/<br>Deterrence      | Utilitarianism   |
| Rectification/<br>Compensation | Utilitarianism   |


## Responsibility in the Cognitive Dimension
- **More above over action**: Not all correct judgments about responsibility should lead to overt reactions. 
- **The moral luck problem**: Not all equal judgements about responsibility should lead to equal overt reactions.  *(drunk driver case)*
- **Separatism** between responsibility judgements and overt responses: 
	- How much compensation is due - from the call for rectification and retribution
	- Relevant standing to blame - someone might lose the right to utter a complaint *(bad father case)*
	- Private acts - beyond the reach of strangers

### Standard Conditions for Responsibility
- wrongdoing
	- depends on which ethical lens/theory
- freedom of action
	- being in control of one's will and actions
	- condition is absent, when one is tied up or imprisoned
	- condition is absent in cases of addition, and mental health issues/disorders
- foreseeability
	- wilful ignorance does not serve as an excuse
- casual contribution
	- **Recklessness** without any causal effects can be considered a wrongdoing in itself - One can be blamed for the 'causeless' imposition of risks
	- **Omissions**: intentional acts that are best characterized as voluntary non-interference (letting Y intentionally happen while one could have prevented Y from happening by doing X)
		- With increased ability, the range of ==control== increases. The skills undergird an increased responsibility


## Responsibility in the Emotional/Affective Dimension
- We expect certain **emotional reactions of wrongdoers** (and rightdoers) as part of their responsibility.
-  **Appropriateness of those emotional responses** depends again on whether cognitive judgment is correct – but can also go significantly beyond it.
- Our feelings (the **spectator’s feelings**) also change and should change depending on someone else's wrongdoing.
- Paradigmatic affective responses associated with responsibility:
	-Pride (if something turned out well) / Shame / Guilt / Remorse / ==Agent-regret== (Williams) / Anger (perhaps the underlying feeling that disposes to demand retribution) / Forgiveness
	*Agent-regret arises when someone feels personally involved in causing harm, even if they are not morally blameworthy.*

Overall: the Oppenheimer Case (need to review)


# Lecture 5 - Justice
## Dimensions of Justice
- **Access to certain goods**: Infrastructures, education, medical services, jobs, positions of power...
- **Right**: right to vote, the right to speak freely, right to fair legal process...
- **Distribution of certain goods**: material goods, wealth...
- **Domination and sovereignty**: who holds power/rules over whom (if anyone must hold power over anybody)

Justice and Technology


## Theories of Justice
Justice is not equal to Equality (a complicated relationship)

- **Libertarians** (Hayek, Robert Nozick): emphasize the importance of liberty - Each should have the right to **conduct business transactions in free markets** the way they please. If this results in unequal pay/wealth, then those results are just.  
	- People with **disabilities**' access to public transport costs more, but those expenses are justified in order for them to make use of their rights.
	
- **Egalitarians**: many people's access to free markets is constrained. The markets are never ideal and the differences in wealth they cause are, therefore, not justified. 
	- John Rawls' "**Veil of Ignorance**"
	![[Week 5 - Justice#Rawls - Veil of Ignorance]]

### Equality of Opportunity

What is the frame of reference?

> [!Case] 
> In a job application for 10 engineers, there are 70% men and 30% women
> Solution 1: Hire 7 men and 3 women by quota
> Solution 2: Hire purely based on qualification

... those who have the same level of **talent and ability**, and have the **same willingness** to use them, should have the same prospects of success \[chance for success] regardless of their initial place in the social system. 

- Rawls: **Not applying seems to indicate an unwillingness** to use your talents and abilities. So that suggest that the right frame of reference to determin equality of opportunity is application numbers...

- Willingness, ability and talent are strongly intertwined. But there are people who have the talent but because of the respective values in their culture/families, they **never foster these talents** to acquire these abilities.
- What people are likely to develop "the willingness to make an effort" to do **depends on what they see as a real possibility for them**, and on what they come to value, and these things will be different for people growing up in different communities.

-> We can't see application numbers as an expression of willingness!
- We could justify the **5/5 quota** following Rawls. Only this quota would give each woman (in relation to the entire population) the same chances of getting the engineering job (equality of opportunity). 


Why not hire based on qualification?
1. Qualification (on paper) is itself a product of possibly **unjust educational dynamics**. -> Women who score equally well **might be actually the better applicants**, given the structural discriminations they had to face through their entire educational trajectory. 
2. Ambiguities of qualification: Many professional goals are collective. A gender **diverse composed group might do better**, even though it contains members that are less qualified for their respective tasks. 
3. Undermine men's chance?: That can be justified if such inequality is "to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society" (**the difference principle**)


Why is the companies duty?
- Societies have moral duties to **ensure educational equality** of opportunity
- but **companies could contribute with their hiring decisions** to deconstruct certain stereotypes and thereby also contribute to societal values that improve educational equality of opportunity
- In many hiring procedures, only one person can be hired - Then the “quota” could be **sequentially applied**. 


## Technology and Work

Automation & technological unemployment
- Keynes’ “technological unemployment” notion: automation can outpace the economy’s ability to **create new kinds of jobs**. The lecture situates contemporary concerns in this long-standing debate.


Frey & Osborne (2013):
- Their influential study of ~700 occupations suggested a large share of U.S. jobs are **at high risk of computerization** over a couple of decades, including some cognitive high-paid roles (diagnosis, legal analysis). The lecture cites this to show automation risks are broad.


The “Great Decoupling” — Brynjolfsson & McAfee
1. machines increasingly replace mental tasks (not just muscle), reducing demand for routine information work while **increasing demand for very high-skill labor**;
2. the near-zero marginal cost of digital goods yields winner-take-all markets and concentrated wealth, eroding the middle class.


Social & economic impacts
- Work supplies identity, self-esteem, and social relations—mass unemployment has social harms. 
- Economically, fewer employed consumers reduces demand. **The speed mismatch between automation and creation of new work** is central.


### Policy responses (from lecture and cited literature)
1. **Employment protection** (restrictions/mandates to keep humans in the loop).
2. **Work sharing** (shorter weeks, more vacation, retirement policies).
3. **Creating new work** (public programs, national service).
4. **Education** (lifelong learning, curriculum updates).
5. **A new social contract** (e.g., decouple care from paid labor).
6. **Redistribution** (Universal Basic Income).


Universal Basic Income ==(UBI)== pros & cons
- UBI: unconditional, equal payments to everyone. 
- Pros: preserves work incentives for earners, avoids poverty traps, simplifies welfare. 
- Cons: costly, politically difficult, may inadequately compensate those who cannot work. 
*The lecture invites critical evaluation.*

Meaningful work
- Five aspects: pursuing a purpose, social relationships, exercising skills and self-development, self-esteem & recognition, and autonomy. 
- These criteria help decide what aspects of work to preserve or redesign
