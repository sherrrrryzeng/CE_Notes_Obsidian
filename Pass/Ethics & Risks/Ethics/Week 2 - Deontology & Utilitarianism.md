## 3.1 Introduction Case - The Ford Pinto

- The safety aspect of the design did not receive sufficient priority.

- The extra costs of $11 did not weigh against the benefit that society would derive from a smaller number of wounded passengers or fatalities.

- Expressing the value of human life in monetary terms involves the danger of neglecting fundamental human rights.

- The role of ethical theories is to provide certain arguments or reasons for a moral judgment.




## 3.2 Ethics & Morality
- **Ethics**: the systematic reflection on what is moral.
- **Morality**: the totality of opinions, decisions, and actions with which people express what they think is good or right.
-  ==Ethics is a process of searching for the right kind of morality.==


### Descriptive vs Normative Ethics
**Descriptive Ethics:**
- The description of existing morality.
- Studies morality in subcultures or during certain historical periods.

**Prescriptive/Normative Ethics:**
- Judges morality.
- Provides viewpoints to critically discuss moral issues.


## 3.3 Descriptive vs Normative Judgments
- **Normative judgment**: value judgments (how the world ==_should_== be).

- **Descriptive judgment**: truth not always determined (testing may be impossible).
	-Science plays an important role in determining truth of descriptive judgments.




## 3.4 Points of Departure: Values, Norms, and Virtues

### Values
-Preferences or interests.
- **Moral values**: guide goals worth striving for (good life, just society).
- **Intrinsic value**: objective in itself.
- **Instrumental value**: means to achieve intrinsic value.

### Norms
-Values translated into rules.
-Rules about how people should treat each other.
- **Moral norms**: prescribe required, permitted, or forbidden actions.
	-Example: traffic rules (legal norms).


| Values                         | Norms                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Ends                           | Means                      |
| Global                         | Specific                   |
| Hard to  achieve without norms | Ineffective without values |


### Virtues
- **Moral virtues**: character traits making someone a good person.
- **Intellectual virtues**: focus on knowledge and skills.
- Difference from values: virtue involves character development.



## 3.5 Relativism & Absolutism

### Normative Relativism
- Moral judgment = personal opinion.
- No universal norms.
- All cultures equal.
- **Problems**: contradiction, blocks moral discussion, unworkable.

### Absolutism
- Universal norms with no exceptions.
- **Problems**:
    - Best action not universal.
    - No solution for conflicting norms.
    - Dogmatism leaves no room for moral judgment.



## 3.6 Primary Ethical Theories
**Structure of action**: Actor + intention → consequences.

|Ethical Theory|Perspective|Point of Departure|
|---|---|---|
|Virtue Ethics|Actor|Virtues|
|Deontology (Duty Ethics)|Action|Norms|
|Consequentialism|Consequences|Values|


## 3.7 Utilitarianism 
- Definition:
	- One type of Consequentialism - focuses on the outcomes of **action**s
	- An action is morally right if it produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.
	
- **Jeremy Bentham**:
    - Hedonism: Pleasure = only intrinsic good.
    - ==Utility principle==: greatest happiness for greatest number.
    - Money as measure of pleasure/pain.
    
- **John Stuart Mill**:
    - Higher desires (intellectual and moral pursuits) > lower desires (bodily or animal desires)
    - ==Freedom principle==: pursue own pleasure without harming others.
    
- Criticism:
	- Happiness not measurable.
	- Exploitation possible.
	- Consequences unpredictable.
	- Unjust division of costs/benefits.
	- Ignores personal relationships.
	- Some moral acts ≠ pleasure maximizing.
    
- **Rule utilitarianism**: 
	- A refined version of utilitarianism that acknowledges moral rules.
	- Close to deontological thinking
	

**Ford Pinto Case**:
- Ford’s argument was utilitarian, not egoistic.
- Compensation calculations arbitrary.
- Sacrificed victims for welfare.
- In rule utilitarianism: maximizes utility but ethically wrong.



## 3.8 Kantian Theory (Duty Ethics/Deontology)
- Definition:
	- The morality of an ==action== depends on whether it follows moral duties or rules, not on its consequences.
	
- **Immanuel Kant**:
    - **Monistic**: all moral actions stem from one central principle
    - **Autonomy**: the capacity to act according to one's own rational moral law --- We act with **good will**.
    - ==**Categorical imperative**==: Universal moral norms - Kant's moral law that applies universally and unconditionally.
	    - *Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should be come a universal law.*
    - **==Reciprocity principle**==: treat humanity always as an end, never as a means only.
    
- Properties:
    - It's not the same thing as the golden rule - not about want or like
    - It captures well people intuitions that some acts are wrong disregarding the (beneficial) consequences
    - The universality of certain duties is well reflected in declarations of human rights and constitutions.
	
- Criticisms:
	- **Schizophrenia**: Inconsistent system of norms.
	- **Rigorism**: No exceptions allowed.
	- **Maxims**: need to be clarified precisely
    
- **William David Ross**: 
	- Critique of Kant's rigidity
	- ==Pluralistic duty ethics== 
		- First level: prima facie norms *(at first sight)*
			- self-evident moral obligations that are binding unless overridden by stronger ones
		- Second level: self-evident norms
    - Issues: unclear weighting, blindness to consequences, context-dependence.

**Ford Pinto Case**:
- Ford’s action violated universality and reciprocity principles.



## 3.9 Virtue Ethics
- Focus: nature of actor & character development.
    
- **Aristotle**: highest good = eudaimonia (flourishing).
	- Good life realized by virtuous activities.
	- Virtues = middle course between extremes.
	
- **Thomas Aquinas**: reconciled the virtue ethics with Christian doctrine
	- 4 Cardinal Virtues: prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude
	- 3 Theological Virtues: faith, hope, charity
	
- Criticism
	- Similar to duty ethics.
	- No concrete case guidance.
	- Can virtues be declared good in themselves? (psychopath issue).
    
- Virtues for responsible engineers:
	- Expertise, communication, cooperation, compromise, objectivity, openness to criticism, stamina, creativity, quality, detail, careful reporting.
	

**Case: LeMessurier (Citicorp Center)**
- Courage, solution-oriented, openness to criticism.


### Charles Harris - Good Engineer and Virtue Ethics
- He argues that traditional engineering ethics (**Preventive Ethics**), based on negative rules ("do not"), is insufficient. He proposes a **Virtue Ethics** approach, aiming to create engineers who do the right thing based on their character and judgment, not just because a rule requires it. 

- ==Four Key Engineering Virtues:==
1. Technical Prudence (Sensitivity to risk)
2. Techno-Social Sensitivity
3. Respect for Nature
4. Commitment to the Public Good

- How to achieve this:
	Cultivating these virtues requires integrating humanities and social sciences into engineering education. 



## 3.10 Care Ethics
- **Carol Gilligan**: norms learned in context through relationships.
    
- Emphasizes lived reality, connectedness, vulnerability, dependence.
	
- Problems
	- Philosophically vague.
	- Unclear what "care" entails.
	- Lacks concrete guidance.


### Lecture context
- What is care?
	- Beyond the sickbed
	- Beyond humans
	- Direct actions
	- Institutional/Systemic
	
- Why is care ethics "new/alternative/radical":
	- Associated with femininity and weakness
	- Not rule-based or formulaic *hard to incorporate*
	- Relational and dependent as foundational


### Maurice Hamington - Integrating Care Ethics and Design
Caring Design = combining **Care Ethics** and **Design Thinking**.

- Design Thinking: 
	The core idea is to be **human-centered**. It involves steps like empathizing with users, defining problems, brainstorming ideas, building prototypes, and testing them.
    In short, it's about deeply understanding people's real needs and feelings to create better solutions for them.
    
- Care Ethics:
	It is about genuinely understanding someone's situation and being committed to helping them.
	
- The "Caring Design" Combo:
	- Similarities:
		- **Inquiry**: Both require a deep desire to understand
		- **Empathy**: Both see feeling with another person as a crucial step towards helping them
		- **Culture Change**: Both aim to create supportive environments where collaboration, learning from failure, and trust are encouraged. 
	- Benefits:
		- For Design Thinking: Care Ethics gives it a **moral heart**. It makes sure this powerful innovation tool is used for good, not just for profit. It transforms it from a neutral process into a purposeful one aimed at genuine well-being.
		- For Care Ethics: Design Thinking gives it a **practical toolkit**. It provides a clear, step-by-step process (like prototyping) to turn the intention of caring into real, scalable actions that can solve big social problems.
	
- How do we teach this?
	Instead of teaching ethics as a separate, theoretical subject, it should be woven into all courses. Students should learn to tackle business challenges by simultaneously using collaborative problem-solving skills _and_ a relational, caring mindset.



## 3.11 Applied Ethics
- Applies moral theories to specific situations.
	
- Problems
	- No universally accepted principles.
	- No straightforward application.
	- Cannot solve all issues.
	- Aims to systematize judgments.
	
- Role of theories in applied ethics:
	- Identify ethical aspects of problems.
	- Provide arguments for moral judgments.



# Chapter 3: Q&A
## 1. Mention a number of differences between values and norms, and between values and virtues.

- **Values vs. Norms**:  
  - Values are abstract goals or ideals worth striving for (e.g., safety, justice), while norms are concrete rules that prescribe or prohibit specific actions (e.g., traffic laws).  
  - Values are ends; norms are means to achieve those ends.  
  - Values are global and hard to achieve without norms; norms are specific and ineffective without underlying values.  

- **Values vs. Virtues**:  
  - Values are ideals or goals, while virtues are character traits that enable a person to realize those values (e.g., honesty, courage).  
  - Values define what is worth pursuing; virtues define the qualities of a person who pursues them.  
  - Virtues are developed through practice and habituation, whereas values are more abstract and guiding.

## 2. Which of the following statements are descriptive, and which are normative?

a. People should accept the risks of nuclear energy.  
b. The majority of your colleagues finds this proposal unacceptable.  
c. There is life on Mars.  
d. Engineers who blow the whistle are usually in a weak position from a legal point of view.

**Answer:**  
- a. Normative  
- b. Descriptive  
- c. Descriptive  
- d. Descriptive

## 3. Describe the main ideas of ‘normative relativism’. What are the criticisms of normative relativism?

- **Main ideas**: Normative relativism holds that all moral viewpoints are relative to individuals or cultures. There are no universal norms; what is right or wrong depends on personal or cultural perspective. All moral systems are considered equally valid.  
- **Criticisms**:  
  1. It involves a contradiction: it claims there are no universal norms but implicitly uses one (“respect all moral opinions”).  
  2. It makes moral discussion impossible, as any opinion is considered equally valid.  
  3. It can lead to unworkable or intolerable situations, such as condoning practices like torture if they are culturally accepted.

## 4. John Stuart Mill has argued that Kant’s ethics is really a masked version of consequentialism because the consequences of actions do play an important role in his ethics – in spite of what Kant himself says. Why do you think that Mill is arguing this despite the fact that Kant himself denies that consequences are relevant to his theory? Do you agree with Mill? Explain why or why not.

- Mill may argue this because Kant’s universalization test implicitly considers consequences: when evaluating whether a maxim can be universalized without contradiction, we often consider what would happen if everyone acted that way (a consequentialist consideration).  
- However, Kant explicitly rejects consequences as the basis for morality, focusing instead on duty and the categorical imperative.  
- Whether one agrees with Mill depends on interpretation. Kant’s theory is fundamentally non-consequentialist, but the application of the universality principle may involve hypothetical reasoning about outcomes.

---

## 5. Describe the main ideas of Bentham’s utilitarianism. What criticism of Bentham’s theory did Mill articulate?

- **Bentham’s utilitarianism**: Actions are judged by their utility in promoting pleasure and avoiding pain. The goal is the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Pleasure is quantified using factors like intensity, duration, certainty, and extent.  
- **Mill’s criticism**:  
  - Bentham ignores qualitative differences in pleasures (e.g., intellectual vs. physical).  
  - He fails to protect individual rights and may justify exploitation of minorities if it benefits the majority.

---

## 6. What is rule utilitarianism? Describe how a rule utilitarian would go about determining whether I may ‘copy and paste’ my essay from internet for a course. How would this differ from how an act utilitarian would reach a decision on this matter?

- **Rule utilitarianism**: Evaluates the morality of rules rather than individual acts. A rule is moral if its general adoption maximizes happiness.  
- **Rule utilitarian approach**: Would ask whether a general rule against plagiarism promotes overall happiness. Since academic integrity supports trust and learning, the rule against plagiarism would be upheld.  
- **Act utilitarian approach**: Would consider whether copying this particular essay maximizes happiness in this specific case (e.g., if it avoids stress and has no negative consequences). The act might be justified situationally.

---

## 7. Describe the main idea of care ethics. What criticism do care ethicists have of utilitarianism and Kantian theory?

- **Main idea**: Care ethics emphasizes relationships, empathy, and responsibility toward others, especially the vulnerable. It rejects abstract principles in favor of contextual, relational morality.  
- **Criticism of utilitarianism and Kantian theory**:  
  - They are too abstract and ignore personal relationships and emotions.  
  - They assume impartiality, neglecting special obligations to those we are connected with.  
  - They overlook the moral significance of care, dependency, and vulnerability.

## 8. You had helped a colleague with her work; and this colleague happened to be rather pretty. Why not having an affair with her, you think. And since she is Kantian, you argue as follows: “If you really want to express respect for me, then you should join me for a drink in my room. Otherwise you would have treated me only as a means and – as a good Kantian – that is not something you can possibly want!”

a. What is it to treat someone only as a means according to Kant?  
b. What is it to treat someone as an end according to Kant?  
c. What is her answer if she is a good Kantian?

**Answer:**  
- a. Treating someone only as a means is using them for your own purposes without regard for their autonomy or goals.  
- b. Treating someone as an end means respecting their rationality and autonomy, involving them in decisions that affect them.  
- c. A good Kantian would reject the argument: agreeing to a drink under manipulative reasoning is not autonomous consent. She would argue that true respect requires honest communication, not coercion disguised as respect.

## 9. Suppose that it is possible to download copyrighted music through the internet without paying for it. Suppose that the makers of such music (the artists) do not want their music freely copied in this way.

a. How would Kant address the question of whether it is morally permissible to download such music by such artists without paying for it? Explain in detail what a Kantian would say.  
b. Would a utilitarian give a different answer? Why or why not?

**Answer:**  
- a. A Kantian would apply the universality principle: if everyone downloaded music without paying, the institution of artistic ownership and compensation would collapse. This leads to a contradiction, so the maxim cannot be universalized. It also treats artists merely as means by disregarding their will and rights.  
- b. A utilitarian might justify downloading if it brings more pleasure (free access) than pain (minor loss to artists). However, if widespread downloading harms artistic production, it could be deemed wrong. The answer depends on the net utility.

## 10. James is an engineer working for the company AERO that produces aero-engines. 
The company is developing a new type of aero-engine called the FANX. James is responsible for the testing of the FANX. He is in the middle of conducting a range of crucial tests for the reliability of the new aero-engine. Yesterday, Bill – who is James’ boss - has asked James to finish his test reports within a week because an important potential customer will visit AERO next week and wants to have a look at the first test reports. James first reaction is to refuse Bill’s request: he is not able to finish the test report within a week; he first needs to do more tests. James considers these additional tests crucial for gaining good insight in the reliability of the FANX. Bill tells James to abandon the planned other tests and to start writing his report immediately. Later, there will be more time to do the other tests. Bill also tells James that if James refuses he will ask Eric to write the report. James says that he really needs more time. Moreover, he objects, Eric is not knowledgeable of the tests and will not be able to write a sound report. After the meeting, James contacts Eric who says that he agrees with Bill and that he will finish the test reports if Bill asks him to do so. Suppose that James the next day decides to follow Bill’s order and to finish the reports immediately, abandoning the other tests.

a. Can this choice of James be justified in utilitarian terms? Explain why or why not.  
b. What should James do if he would try to apply Kant’s categorical imperative to this situation? Argue your answer.  
c. What virtues are relevant for an engineer doing tests like James? Mention at least four.  
d. What action is supported by these virtues? Argue your answer.  
e. Which normative theory is in your opinion best able to deal with this moral problem? Argue why.

**Answer:**  
- a. **Utilitarian view**: James’s choice might be justified if releasing the report early brings more overall benefit (e.g., securing a contract, saving jobs). However, if incomplete testing leads to future failures or accidents, the negative consequences would outweigh the benefits. Utilitarianism would require a careful calculation of likely outcomes.  
- b. **Kantian view**: James should ask whether the maxim “submit incomplete test reports under pressure” can be universalized. If all engineers did this, trust in engineering reports would collapse. Thus, it cannot be universalized. James should refuse to submit an incomplete report.  
- c. **Relevant virtues**: honesty, responsibility, professionalism, courage.  
- d. **Action supported by virtues**: A virtuous engineer would prioritize safety and integrity over pressure, complete the necessary tests, and communicate the need for thoroughness.  
- e. **Best theory**: Virtue ethics or duty ethics may be most appropriate here because they emphasize integrity and professional duty, which are central to engineering ethics. Utilitarianism could justify risky shortcuts, while virtue and duty ethics uphold standards even under pressure.
