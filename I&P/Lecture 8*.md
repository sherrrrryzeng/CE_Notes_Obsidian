# Powder Flow
   Powder flow, or **flowability**, is defined as the relative movement of a bulk of particles among neighbouring particles or along the piece of equipment wall surface. 

## Solids Mixing
   The reorientation of particles relative to one another in order to achieve uniformity. 

Mixing mechanism:
- Diffusion
- Convection
- Shear

### Coating
When mixing coarser and finer particles at high intensity, smaller particles ‘stick’ to coarser particles due to van der Waals forces -> coating![[87f60ebe0d5a398492d6f7568cb15fa571e08192eda023e0dadcbaa8ef4b7217.png]]

For general mixing purposes a RSD value < 5% is acceptable, while for pharmaceutical tablets a RSD < 2% can be required

In general:
- RSD can be influenced significantly by a few outliers
- More samples → larger chance of an outlier
- More samples → smaller influence of each outlier


## Solids Drying
   The removal of water or other liquids from a solid. 

Purpose of drying:
- To remove moisture which may lead to loss of product quality/activity
- To improve the properties of a material: e.g. flowability, compressibility, stability
- To reduce the cost of transportation of large volume of materials
- To improve the handling and storage


### Moisture
- **Free moisture**: Moisture that is flowing freely, relatively far away from solid particles
- **Surface moisture**: Moisture on the surface of solid particles
- **Absorbed moisture**: Moisture inside solid particles
- **Chemically bound moisture**: Moisture bound to molecules

Difficulty to remove: Free moisture < surface moisture < absorbed moisture < chemically bound moisture
