## Colloids
### **Stable colloidal dispersion**
 Colloidal dispersions are **thermodynamically unstable**, because the configuration with the lowest free energy is reached only when all particles are aggregated. However, when a colloidal dispersion has an **energy barrier** sufficiently large enough with respect to the thermal energy of the solvent particles, we consider the colloidal dispersion **kinetic stable**. 
*The energy barrier comes from repulsions(DLVO theory).* 

### **Which properties affect particles in a colloidal dispersion?**
 - Size and density - sedimentation/creaming
 - **Hamaker constant** - van der Waals attraction
 - Surface charge - electrostatic interaction
 
### **How is a charged-stabilised colloidal system affected by electrolyte concentration?**
 For increasing electrolyte concentration, 
- conductivity $\sigma$ increases, the Debye length $\lambda_D=\sqrt{\frac{D\epsilon}{\sigma}}$ decreases, 
- the range of electrostatic repulsion is smaller, 
- the **screening** effect for electrostatic increases,
	-> repulsion (-)
- the difference of electrolyte concentrations for osmotic effect decreases
	-> repulsion (-)


### **Which properties does one need to consider for depletion?**
- Whether the polymer depletant is non-adsorbing;
- The size of the polymer depletant $R_g$;
- The concentration of the depletant $n$. 


## Surface tension
### **Explain surface tension as force**
 All particles are affected by **inter-particle attractions** *(such as van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds)* from neighbouring particles. In the bulk, these attractions cancel out in every direction. However, at an interface, the resulting **imbalance of cohesive forces** pulls the particles towards the interior of the side whose attraction is stronger. This surface tension causes the surface to contract and behave like a stretched membrane.

### **Explain surface tension as free energy**
 The surface area of a dispersed system costs energy. Particles at the surface have **higher free energy** than those in the bulk. 
 The surface has a tendency to contract spontaneously in order to **minimise the surface area**. Therefore, droplets and bubbles tend to adopt a spherical shape, which reduces the total surface free energy. 

### **Anionic surfactants in detergent** *not in slides*
 1. **Wetting**: surfactants highly decrease the surface tension of water, allowing it to penetrate deep into the tiny gaps of the fabric or around grease particles.
 2. **Removal**: the hydrophobic tails are attracted to dirt, while the anionic heads stay sticking out into the water and pull the tails up and off the surface.
 3. **Suspension**: The surfactant molecules create micelles and trap the oily dirt in the centre. 
 4. **Negative Charge**: creates repulsion so that dirt will not stick to each other and also fibre surfaces. 

### **Pickering emulsion**
 The stability in Pickering emulsion is achieved using solid micro- or nano- particles. The stability mechanisms are:
- **Particle adsorption**: Solid particles at the interface have **large capillary energy** that prevent themselves from desorption.
- **Physical barrier**: Solid particles accumulate at interfaces. When particles at the surface are crowded enough to form a dense, rigid film (jamming), it acts as a mechanical shell to prevent droplets from coalescence.


## Granular Matters
### **Angle of repose**
When powders are gently poor on to a heap, the angle of the side of the heap with the horizontal line is the angle of repose. It gives a value for the flowability of a powder. 

 When particles are dropping on a heap, the main forces acting on them are:
	- gravity
	- **impact forces** *(external)*
 What prevents the particles to stop rolling off the heap are:
	- **friction** forces between particles
	- **interlocking** due to non-spherical shape
	- van der Waals attraction *(for small particles)*

### **Segregation**
#### **The Brazil nut effect (BNE) / Void Filling** 
 When the container is shaken or vibrated, temporary voids are created between particles by random motions. Small particles fall into these newly created voids due to gravity and move downward, while large particles are too big to fit into these gaps. Therefore, large Brazil nuts accumulate on top. 

 How to prevent BNE by changing the product properties?
1) **Narrow size distribution** *at least to critical size ratio (1.15:1)*
2) **Reduce absolute size**: as particle size decreases interparticle forces *(such as mechanical, van de Waals, electrostatic and capillary forces)* dominate over gravity.
3) **Change the ratio of particles**: Brazil nut effect is more significant when concentration of fine particles is 15-30%. 
4) **Avoid irregular shaped particles**: they can more easily ‘fall’ through void space and the void spaces formed from irregular particles are larger than those for spherical-shaped particles.
5) **Density**: if you give the large particles a larger density, you make counter their tendency to go to the top.

The BNE describes that when vibration or shaking happens, temporary voids are created in the system between particles. Small particles are able to go down within the voids due to gravity, while large particles are reversibly "pushed" upward. 

How to minimise the effect:
- Decrease size distribution (uniform size)
- Decrease size
- Increase density of large particles
- avoid non-spherical shapes
#### **Fluidisation Segregation**
 Fluidisation segregations becomes more significant when fine particle concentration is higher >60%.
 The small particles are numerous enough to be easily aerated and the system behaves more like a fluid. Large particles often sink or stay at the bottom because their density is larger than the fluidised bed of fine particles. 

 How to prevent segregation by changing the product handling?
 1) **Minimise vibration**
 2) **Minimise humidity (changes)**
 3) **Lower free-fall height**
 4) **Pack it under vacuum**


### **Caking**
 Definition: a free-flowing material is transformed into a lumpy or cohesive material.
 Origin:
	- mechanical blockage - physical interlocking or "jamming"
	- particle size distribution *(fine particles fill the voids between larger ones)*
	- surface interaction - capillary bridges


## Emulsions
### **Stable emulsions**
 Same as colloids, emulsions are **thermodynamically unstable**, because the configuration with the lowest free energy is reached only when all particles are aggregated. 
 In a emulsion there are two **immiscible liquid phases**. When one liquid is dispersed into the other as droplets, interface between two phases is created. As creating interfaces costs energy, this process increases the total free energy of the system. 
 ==Stable emulsions can be formed if the **interfacial tension is very low**.== This can be achieved by changing fluid properties, or by adding surfactants. 


### **Choosing surfactants**
While both surfactants decrease the surface tension, we also need to consider HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) value. According to **Bancroft rule**, the phase in which the emulsifier is more soluble becomes a continuous phase. Therefore, to form a stable O/W emulsion, surfactants with HLB>10 are more desirable. 
At the same time, surfactants with a higher **charge** could enhance electrostatic repulsion, and surfactants with **larger chain length** could enhance steric repulsion. With the right amount of repulsion emulsion droplets are protected against coalescence. 


### **Micelles**
CMC: As the surfactant concentration increases, the surface tension will not decrease infinitely. This is because that there is limited space at the interface. Eventually it becomes **too packed to adsorb any additional surfactant** (which is called saturation). At this point, micellisation occurs. 

Micelle formation is spontaneous:
Although micelle formation increases surface area and creates an ordered system, micellisation **increases entropy by freeing up water molecules**. Solvating hydrophobic tails with water is unfavourable entropically, as it causes significant water ordering.


### **Addition of salt**
![[aa2fabf8df4ca40b1f633bb2e8cb1d68eca5df95ce0a7e7e988ef613908dc268.png]]
AOT has an anionic headgroup that is sensitive to the cation of NaCl. Initially salt screens electrostatic repulsion so AOT packs more densely at the interface. 
Beyond an optimal salinity, **==salting-out/dehydration==** shifts surfactant into oil phase, reducing interfacial coverage and increasing surface tension. 
(HLB value will be around 10)

### **Addition of polymer**
- **Non-adsorbing polymer -> Depletion**
	 The addition of non-adsorbing polymers increases the concentration of the bulk system. When particles overlap, there is a **osmotic effect** between the bulk and the overlapping area, which is too small for polymers to enter. The osmotic effect pushes particles to overlap and coalescence. 
	 Also the overlapping and coalescence of particles give space to polymers, which increases the **entropy** of the system.
